Shortwave Cloud Radiative Effects and Parasol Reflectance for a given non-overlapped low-level cloud cover

The plots show the shortwave cloud radiative effects and Parasol reflectance for a given nonoverlapped
low-level cloud cover in tropical subsidence zones; more specifically, when omega500hPa and
omega700hPa is greater than 10 hPa day-1 and high- and mid-level cloud cover is less than 5%.
